Index to the Source Code Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I've tested every example in the book (apart from Chapters 10, 13 and 17 which
Apress reviewed on my behalf) and copied the working code at each step into the
examples you see in this index. I've also reported any problems and the
required corrections to Apress so what you see in these examples should match
exactly what is in the book. I hope you find them useful!

These 164 examples were generated with Pylons 0.9.7rc2, SQLAlchemy 0.5rc1 andi
the development versions of their required dependencies. They have been
developed in such a way that they should also work with the release versions
too but it is possible that things will change between now and when you test
the examples for yourself. If you have difficulties try comparing your version
to the version here for clues. You can do that with this command::

    $ diff -ur MyCodeDirectory YourCodeDirectory

If you still have problems visit the Pylons Book site at http://pylonsbook.com
for updates or ask on the Pylons mailing list. We have a friendly community and
I'm sure someone will be happy to help you.

All the source code is licensed under a BSD license so you can use it in your
own projects. Some of the examples also include YUI which is licensed
separately. The licenses are at the end of this file.
